# RNApipeline
In this repository I will store usefull scripts for processing and analysing RNA samples.
The first upload is a series of test scripts I've used to parse through the HTML files that come out as a result of FastQC analysis on RNA samples.
The main idea is that these scripts should retrieve the information regarding the total number of sequences in each samples, as a way to quickly compare
Sequence quantity between samples.
